## **📚 Learn**  

### **1. Database Design**  
Organizing data into structured tables and defining relationships is a core part of data engineering. Understanding database design helps ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.  
*(Note: Some of these database design courses are very long and detailed. Below are suggestions on what to focus on, depending on your goals.)*

🌟 **Key Concepts:**  
- **Normalization:** Breaking data into smaller tables to reduce redundancy.  
- **Schema Design:** Structuring data logically to meet specific use cases.  

### What to Focus On
- If You’re Just Getting Started:  
  - Learn the basics of schema design, including tables, relationships, primary keys, and foreign keys.  
  - Understand normalization at a high level to avoid redundancy and maintain consistency in your data.  

- If You’re Building a Project:  
  - Design schemas that fit your use case, such as handling transactional systems or optimizing for high-volume data pipelines.  
  - Explore indexing and query optimization to improve performance as your database scales.  

- If You Want In-Depth Knowledge:  
  - Take a full course to dive deeper into advanced topics like denormalization and database performance tuning.  
  - Learn about trade-offs in database design, such as balancing performance and flexibility.

### **2. Data Warehousing**  
A data warehouse is a centralized repository for storing large volumes of structured and semi-structured data for analysis.  

🌟 **Key Concepts:**  
- **OLAP vs. OLTP:** Differences between analytical and transactional systems.  
- **ETL/ELT Workflows:** Transforming raw data into structured formats for analytics.  
- **Partitioning and Indexing:** Techniques for optimizing query performance.

### **3. Big Data**  
Big data refers to datasets that are too large or complex for traditional systems to process. Understanding how to manage and analyze this data is essential for data engineering.

🌟 **Key Concepts:**  
- **Batch vs. Streaming Data:**  
  - *Batch Processing:* Processes large volumes of data in chunks, such as daily or hourly jobs.  
  - *Streaming Processing:* Handles data in real time as it is generated, enabling low-latency analysis.  

- **The Five V's of Big Data:**  
  - *Volume:* The scale of data being collected.  
  - *Velocity:* The speed at which data is generated and processed.  
  - *Variety:* The different formats of data—structured, semi-structured, and unstructured.  
  - *Veracity:* The reliability and accuracy of the data.  
  - *Value:* The actionable insights that can be derived from the data.  

- **Data Lakes and Lakehouses:**  
  - *Data Lakes:* Flexible storage for raw, unstructured data, requiring additional transformation for analysis.  
  - *Data Lakehouses:* Combine the benefits of data lakes and warehouses, allowing for raw data storage and structured querying.

### **4. ETL vs. ELT**  
Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) and Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) are two common approaches to preparing and processing data.  

🌟 **Key Concepts:**  
- **ETL:** Extract → Transform → Load (traditional).  
- **ELT:** Extract → Load → Transform (modern cloud workflows).
