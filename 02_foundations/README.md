## **📚 Learn**  

### **1. Database Design**  
Organizing data into structured tables and defining relationships is a core part of data engineering. Understanding database design helps ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.  

🌟 **Key Concepts:**  
- **Normalization:** Breaking data into smaller tables to reduce redundancy.  
- **Schema Design:** Structuring data logically to meet specific use cases.

### **2. Data Warehousing**  
A data warehouse is a centralized repository for storing large volumes of structured and semi-structured data for analysis.  

🌟 **Key Concepts:**  
- **OLAP vs. OLTP:** Differences between analytical and transactional systems.  
- **Data Marts:** Smaller, specialized subsets of data warehouses.  

🌟 **Resources:**

### **3. Big Data**  
Big data refers to datasets that are too large or complex for traditional systems to handle. Understanding how to process and analyze big data is critical for modern data engineering.  

🌟 **Key Concepts:**  
- **Batch vs. Streaming Data:**  
  - **Batch Processing:** Processing large amounts of data at once (e.g., nightly jobs).  
  - **Streaming Processing:** Real-time data flow and analysis (e.g., live dashboards).  
- **The Three V's:** Volume, Velocity, and Variety.  (Some frameworks expand this to include Veracity (data trustworthiness) and Value (business usefulness) as well.) 

🌟 **Resources:**

### **4. ETL vs. ELT**  
Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) and Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) are two common approaches to preparing and processing data.  

🌟 **Key Concepts:**  
- **ETL:** Extract → Transform → Load (traditional).  
- **ELT:** Extract → Load → Transform (modern cloud workflows).  

🌟 **Resources:**  
- 📝 [ETL vs. ELT (Fivetran Blog)](https://blog.fivetran.com/etl-vs-elt)  
  *A comparison of ETL and ELT workflows, highlighting their differences and use cases.*

### **5. Data Governance**  
Data governance ensures that data is high-quality, secure, and compliant with regulations. It’s a critical part of managing data in an organization.  

🌟 **Key Concepts:**  
- **Data Lineage:** Tracking the origin and transformations of data.  
- **Data Quality:** Ensuring data is accurate, complete, and reliable.  

🌟 **Resources:**  
- 📝 [What is Data Governance? (Talend)](https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-data-governance/)  
  *An introduction to data governance and its importance.*
