# DEHub: A Comprehensive Data Engineering Resource Hub

A practical guide to understanding data engineering concepts, tools, and workflows.

---

## About

This hub is designed to make your data engineering journey smoother, especially if you‚Äôre just starting out. It provides:  
- A clear learning path covering foundational concepts and essential tools.  
- Carefully selected resources to dive deeper into key techniques and workflows.  
- Pipeline challenges to test and apply the skills you‚Äôve learned.

From SQL basics to building your first pipelines, learning data engineering has never been more structured, accessible, and fun. üöÄ

## How to Use This Repo

1. **Start with the basics:**  
   - Read the [High-Level Overview](./01_high_level_overview/README.md) to understand the big picture of data engineering.
   - Dive into [Foundational Knowledge](./02_foundations/README.md) to learn key concepts like normalization, data warehousing, and ETL workflows.

2. **Learn SQL:**  
   - Explore the [SQL](./03_SQL/README.md) section to learn querying and manipulating data in relational databases.

3. **Learn Python:**  
   - Head to the [Python](./04_python/README.md) section to build data processing and scripting skills.

4. **Master the tools:**  
   - Check out the [Tooling](./05_tooling/README.md) section to learn how to use essential tools like Airflow, dbt, and Kafka.

5. **Build your own pipelines in our pipeline challenges:**  
   - Check out our [Pipeline Challenges](./06_pipeline_challenges/README.md). These hands-on challenges give you a chance to practice building pipelines and apply everything you‚Äôve learned so far.

## Personal Recommendations

I‚Äôve made sure that every topic in this repo is covered with free resources so that anyone, no matter their budget, can learn data engineering. That said, if you‚Äôre thinking about paying for a learning platform, both DataCamp and Codecademy are awesome options:

- **[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com)** is my top pick if you‚Äôre focused on data engineering or data science. They have dedicated skill tracks for data engineering, so if you can only pick one platform, go with DataCamp. If you sign up for the **[GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)**, you get 3 months free, along with access to many other great tools.
- **[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)** is a great choice for learning Python and building solid programming fundamentals, especially if you‚Äôre just starting out.

Whatever resources you choose, make sure you‚Äôre applying what you learn. Don‚Äôt get stuck in 'tutorial hell' ([check out this post on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qrlx5m/what_exactly_is_tutorial_hell/)). For example, when learning Pandas, grab the [official cheat sheet](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf), download a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), and practice those commands yourself. Applying what you‚Äôve learned will make concepts stick far better than just watching videos.
