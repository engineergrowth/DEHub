## How to Use This Repo

1. **Start with the basics:**  
   - Read the <a href="./01_high_level_overview/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-Level Overview</a> to understand the big picture of data engineering.
   - Dive into <a href="./02_foundations/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foundational Knowledge</a> to learn key concepts like normalization, data warehousing, and ETL workflows.

2. **Learn SQL:**  
   - Explore the <a href="./03_SQL/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQL</a> section to learn querying and manipulating data in relational databases.

3. **Learn Python:**  
   - Head to the <a href="./04_python/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a> section to build data processing and scripting skills.

4. **Master the tools:**  
   - Check out the <a href="./05_tooling/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tooling</a> section to learn how to use essential tools like Airflow, dbt, and Kafka.

5. **Build your own pipelines in our pipeline challenges:**  
   - Check out our <a href="./08_pipeline_challenges/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pipeline Challenges</a>. These hands-on challenges give you a chance to practice building pipelines and apply everything you’ve learned so far.

## Personal Recommendations

I’ve made sure that every topic in this repo is covered with free resources so that anyone, no matter their budget, can learn data engineering. That said, if you’re thinking about paying for a learning platform, both DataCamp and Codecademy are awesome options:

- **<a href="https://www.datacamp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DataCamp</a>** is my top pick if you’re focused on data engineering or data science. They have dedicated skill tracks for data engineering, so if you can only pick one platform, go with DataCamp. If you sign up for the **<a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a>**, you get 3 months free, along with access to many other great tools.
- **<a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codecademy</a>** is a great choice for learning Python and building solid programming fundamentals, especially if you’re just starting out.

Whatever resources you choose, make sure you’re applying what you learn. Don’t get stuck in 'tutorial hell' (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qrlx5m/what_exactly_is_tutorial_hell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out this post on it</a>). For example, when learning Pandas, grab the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official cheat sheet</a>, download a dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaggle</a>, and practice those commands yourself. Applying what you’ve learned will make concepts stick far better than just watching videos.
