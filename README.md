   - Dive into <a href="./02_foundations/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foundational Knowledge</a> to learn key concepts like normalization, data warehousing, and ETL workflows.

2. **Learn SQL:**  
   - Explore the <a href="./03_SQL/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQL</a> section to learn querying and manipulating data in relational databases.

3. **Learn Python:**  
   - Head to the <a href="./04_python/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a> section to build data processing and scripting skills.

4. **Master the tools:**  
   - Check out the <a href="./05_tooling/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tooling</a> section to learn how to use essential tools like Airflow, dbt, and Kafka.

### **Important Note About Links**

GitHubâ€™s Markdown viewer doesnâ€™t allow links to open in a new window by default. You have two options to make navigation easier:  

1. **Open Links in a New Tab Manually:**  
   - On most browsers:  
     - **Windows/Linux**: Right-click a link and select *"Open link in new tab"* or use `Ctrl + Click`.  
     - **Mac**: Right-click a link and select *"Open link in new tab"* or use `Cmd + Click`.  

2. **Fork and Clone This Repo Locally:**  
   - **Why Fork?** Forking the repo allows you to customize it, add your own links/notes, and view the links locally in a Markdown viewer or editor where `target="_blank"` works as expected.  
   - **How to Fork and Clone:**  
     - Click the **Fork** button at the top-right of this page to create your own copy.  
     - Clone your fork to your local machine:  
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git
       ```  
     - Open the README in a Markdown viewer or IDE like **VS Code** and enjoy full hyperlink functionality.

## Personal Recommendations

Iâ€™ve made sure that every topic in this repo is covered with free resources so that anyone, no matter their budget, can learn data engineering. That said, if youâ€™re thinking about paying for a learning platform, both DataCamp and Codecademy are awesome options:

- **<a href="https://www.datacamp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DataCamp</a>** is my top pick if youâ€™re focused on data engineering or data science. They have dedicated skill tracks for data engineering, so if you can only pick one platform, go with DataCamp. If you sign up for the **<a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a>**, you get 3 months free, along with access to many other great tools.
- **<a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codecademy</a>** is a great choice for learning Python and building solid programming fundamentals, especially if youâ€™re just starting out.

Whatever resources you choose, make sure youâ€™re applying what you learn. Donâ€™t get stuck in 'tutorial hell' (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qrlx5m/what_exactly_is_tutorial_hell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out this post on it</a>). For example, when learning Pandas, grab the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official cheat sheet</a>, download a dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaggle</a>, and practice those commands yourself. Applying what youâ€™ve learned will make concepts stick far better than just watching videos.
