## **How These Challenges Work**

1. **🗺️ Guided, But Not Hand-Holding**  
   - Each challenge provides a clear objective and a set of tasks, but I won’t provide every line of code or configuration.
   - Your job is to figure out the "how" by researching, reading documentation, and applying what you learn.

2. **💪 Build Problem-Solving Skills**  
   - Researching and troubleshooting are key skills for any technical role. These challenges are meant to help you practice them.

3. **🌟 Learn Through Exploration**  
   - While the instructions give you direction, there’s room for you to think critically and explore multiple approaches.
