# âš¡ **Kafka Fraud Detection Pipeline Challenge**

**Problem**: In today's digital economy, real-time transactions are ubiquitous. However, identifying and responding to suspicious or fraudulent activity in real time is critical for preventing financial losses and maintaining trust.

**Goal**: Use Kafka to:
- Simulate real-time transaction data.
- Process transactions to detect suspicious activity.
- Save flagged and processed transactions for further analysis.


## **Overview**

This challenge involves:
1. Setting up Docker and Docker Compose to run Kafka and Zookeeper.
2. Writing a Kafka producer to simulate real-time transaction data.
3. Writing a Kafka consumer to process transactions, flag suspicious activity, and save results.


## **ðŸ“¦ Step 1: Set Up Docker and Docker Compose**

In this step, you will install Docker and Docker Compose, then use `docker-compose` to set up Kafka and Zookeeper.

### **What You Need to Do**

1. **Install Docker**:
   - Follow the official Docker installation guide for your operating system:
     - [Get Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

2. **Verify Docker Installation**:
   - After installing, run the following command to ensure Docker is installed:
     ```bash
     docker --version
     ```
   - Example output:
     ```plaintext
     Docker version 24.0.2, build cb74dfc
     ```

3. **Install Docker Compose**:
   - Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop on Windows and macOS. For Linux, install Docker Compose using the instructions here:
     - [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

4. **Verify Docker Compose Installation**:
   - Check if Docker Compose is installed:
     ```bash
     docker-compose --version
     ```
   - Example output:
     ```plaintext
     Docker Compose version v2.17.3
     ```

5. **Set Up Kafka and Zookeeper**:
   - Write a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project folder to define services for Kafka and Zookeeper. Make sure to include:
     - **Zookeeper**: Coordinates the Kafka broker.
     - **Kafka**: Manages message queues for the pipeline.

6. **Start Kafka and Zookeeper**:
   - Run the following command to start all services defined in your `docker-compose.yml`:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

7. **Verify Services**:
   - Use the following command to ensure containers are running:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```
   - You should see containers for both `zookeeper` and `kafka`.


## **ðŸ”¨ Step 2: Build the Kafka Producer**

### **Goal**: Create a producer to simulate transactions and send them to Kafka.

#### **Tasks**
1. **Connect the Producer to Kafka**:
   - Use the `kafka-python` library to connect to the broker at `localhost:9092`.
   - Define the topic name: `fraud-transactions`.

2. **Create User and City Data**:
   - Define a list of cities, each with a name, latitude, and longitude.
   - Generate 100 unique user IDs and assign a random home city to each user.

3. **Write a Function to Generate Random Locations**:
   - Simulate a userâ€™s location:
     - 80% of the time, they stay in their home city.
     - 20% of the time, they are in a random city.

4. **Write a Function to Generate Transactions**:
   - Include these fields:
     - `user_id`: Random user ID.
     - `transaction_amount`: Random float between $5.00 and $20,000.00.
     - `location`: Random location for the transaction.
     - `home_city`: Userâ€™s assigned home city.
     - `device_id`: Randomly generated device ID.
     - `timestamp`: Current date and time.

5. **Send Transactions to Kafka**:
   - Use a loop to continuously generate and send transactions.

## **ðŸ”„ Step 3: Build the Kafka Consumer**

### **Goal**: Create a consumer to process transactions, flag suspicious ones, and save the results.

#### **Tasks**

1. **Connect the Consumer to Kafka**:
   - Use the `kafka-python` library to connect to the broker at `localhost:9092`.
   - Subscribe to the topic `fraud-transactions`.

2. **Write a Function to Generate Flags**:
   - This function analyzes each transaction and adds flags based on these rules:
     - **High Transaction Amount**: Flag if `transaction_amount > 10,000`.
     - **Suspicious Location**: Flag if `location` differs from `home_city`.
     - **Rapid Transactions**: Flag if a user makes more than 5 transactions in 60 seconds.

   **Example**:
   - Input:
     ```json
     {
       "user_id": "123",
       "transaction_amount": 15000,
       "location": {"city": "Chicago"},
       "home_city": {"city": "New York"},
       "timestamp": "2024-12-18 11:30:00"
     }
     ```
   - Output:
     ```json
     {
       "flags": ["high_amount", "suspicious_location"]
     }
     ```

3. **Write a Function to Process Transactions**:
   - Accept a transaction as input.
   - Add `flags` and a `processed_at` timestamp to the transaction.

4. **Write a Function to Save Data**:
   - Save all transactions to `processed_transactions.csv`.
   - Save flagged transactions to `flagged_transactions.csv`.

5. **Consume and Process Transactions**:
   - Read messages from Kafka.
   - Process each transaction using the functions above.
   - Save data in batches of 100 transactions.


## **ðŸ“‹ Required Fields for Transactions**

### Producer
- `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user.
- `transaction_amount`: Float value between $5.00 and $20,000.00.
- `location`: The city where the transaction occurred.
- `home_city`: The userâ€™s home city.
- `device_id`: A randomly generated device identifier.
- `timestamp`: Time when the transaction occurred.

### Consumer (Processed Fields)
- `flags`: List of flags (e.g., `high_amount`, `suspicious_location`).
- `processed_at`: Time when the transaction was processed.

## **ðŸš€ Bonus Challenges**

1. **Enhance Fraud Detection**:
   - Create new detection rules/methods

2. **Database Integration**:
   - Save transactions to a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) instead of CSV.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Use Python (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to visualize flagged transactions.
