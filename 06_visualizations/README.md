## Visualization for Data Validation

While data engineers don’t focus heavily on visualization, simple visuals can help validate and communicate pipeline results. This section introduces beginner-friendly tools for quick insights.

### 📊 Python Visuals  
Use Python libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to validate your data outputs:  
- Plot histograms to check data distributions.  
- Use line graphs for trends over time.
