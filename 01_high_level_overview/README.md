## 📊 High-Level Overview of Data Engineering

Data engineering is all about designing, building, and maintaining systems that turn raw data into something meaningful. It’s the backbone of data science and analytics, making data-driven decisions possible.

Data engineers focus on building pipelines to:

Ingest Data: Gather raw data from sources like APIs, databases, and streaming services.
Store Data: Keep the data safe and scalable in places like SQL databases or data lakes.
Transform Data: Clean and process raw data so it’s ready for analysis or machine learning.
Orchestrate Workflows: Automate how data moves through the pipeline.

### Example Pipeline: Personalized Recommendations for E-Commerce

Imagine an online retailer using customer data to suggest relevant products:
- **Ingest Data:** Collect clickstream data from the website and purchase data from the order management system.
- **Store Data:** Save this data in a scalable data warehouse or data lake for analysis.
- **Transform Data:** Clean and aggregate customer behavior data to calculate preferences, frequently bought items, and browsing history.
- **Orchestrate Workflows:** Set up systems to update recommendations on the website in near-real-time based on the latest data.
