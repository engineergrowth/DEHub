## 📊 High-Level Overview of Data Engineering

Data engineering is the process of designing, building, and maintaining systems that allow raw data to be transformed into meaningful insights. It’s the backbone of data science and analytics, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions.

Data engineers work on creating pipelines that:
1. **Ingest Data:** Collect raw data from various sources (e.g., APIs, databases, streaming services).  
2. **Store Data:** Save the data in a secure, scalable storage solution (e.g., SQL databases, data lakes).  
3. **Transform Data:** Clean, filter, and process raw data into formats ready for analysis or machine learning.  
4. **Orchestrate Workflows:** Automate the movement of data through the pipeline.

### Example Pipeline: Personalized Recommendations for E-Commerce

Imagine an online retailer using customer data to suggest relevant products:
- **Ingest Data:** Collect clickstream data from the website and purchase data from the order management system.
- **Store Data:** Save this data in a scalable data warehouse or data lake for analysis.
- **Transform Data:** Clean and aggregate customer behavior data to calculate preferences, frequently bought items, and browsing history.
- **Orchestrate Workflows:** Set up systems to update recommendations on the website in near-real-time based on the latest data.
