# Data Engineering Tools Overview  

This section breaks down the essential tools used in data engineering, organized by their purpose—like ETL, workflow orchestration, and data storage. Each tool includes an overview of its strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases.

You’ll find dedicated folders with resources for some of these tools, and more will be added as this project grows. Consider this a starting point, and check back for updates as I continue learning and exploring new tools.

## How to Choose Tools  
1. **Budget**: 🆓 Open-source tools (e.g., Airflow, dbt) are great for startups, while enterprise tools (e.g., Informatica, Snowflake) may suit larger organizations.  
2. **Ecosystem**: 🔗 Pick tools that integrate well with your cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure).  
3. **Team Skills**: 🐍 Choose tools aligned with your team's expertise (e.g., Python-centric tools like Dask or Airflow for Python developers).  
4. **Scale**: 🚀 For massive datasets, prefer distributed tools like Apache Spark or Snowflake.
